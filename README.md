---Module 2 Challenge---
This week's challenge consisted of creating a professional portfolio to hold our work for possible employers to see. One of the main focuses in the project was to make the portfolio easy to navigate. This was accomplished by creating links that worked properly, and by organizing the webpage layout to flow nicely.
First, I created the HTML file from scratch, having the mock-up webpage as reference. The HTML file contained all the content of the webpage. Lastly, I added styling to the referenced CSS file. The CSS file contained code to make the webpage responsive, using media queries. Below is a screenshot of my professional portfolio.
